        I am a Computer Science and IT student from Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). 
        I love to code because of the challenges and inspiration to build something incredible. 
        A creative person in design, with attention to detail in my work and very passionate about everything I do. 
        With a particular interest in making things simple and automating daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.
        Very young in this field, but that is not a problem for me to learn and gain experience to improve my skill and increase my knowledge.
